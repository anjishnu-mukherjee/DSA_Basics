# 📌 DSA in C

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository! This collection contains C implementations of various DSA topics covered in my college curriculum.

## 📂 Folder Structure

- 📁 **Expressions/** – Evaluation and conversion of infix, postfix, and prefix expressions.
- 📁 **Linked Lists/** – Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- 📁 **Matrix/** – Operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition.
- 📁 **Miscellaneous/** – Other DSA-related implementations that don’t fit into a specific category.
- 📁 **Recursion/** – Recursive solutions to problems such as factorial, Fibonacci, and Tower of Hanoi.
- 📁 **Searching/** – Searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, and hash-based techniques.
- 📁 **Sorting/** – Sorting algorithms including bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort.
- 📁 **Stack Queue/** – Implementation of stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists.
- 📁 **Tree Graph/** – Tree and graph algorithms including traversals, BFS, DFS, and shortest path algorithms.
- 📁 **Practice Questions/** – A collection of random practice problems from various topics.

## ⚡ How to Use
Each folder contains well-commented C programs. Compile and run using **GCC**:
```sh
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```
